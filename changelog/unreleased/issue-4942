Enhancement: create snapshot summary statistics for snapshots which don't have them

When restic rewrite is used with the -s (snapshot-summary) option,
a new snapshot is created containing statistics summary data. Only two fields
will be non-zero: TotalFilesProcessed and TotalBytesProcessed

When restic rewrite is used to remove certain parts of the snapshot, the new feature
will alse be activated.

Enhancement: include include filters in command rewrite

The enhancement allows the standard include filter options
      --iinclude pattern     same as --include pattern but ignores the casing of filenames
      --iinclude-file file   same as --include-file but ignores casing of filenames in patterns
  -i, --include pattern      include a pattern (can be specified multiple times)
      --include-file file    read include patterns from a file (can be specified multiple times)

In addition the option
  -s, --snapshot-summary     create snapshot summary record if it does not exist

To improve space performance of the newly created snapshots via the include filter variants,
it is recommended to utilize the option
	-X, --exclude-empty        exclude empty directories from being created, needs a second walk through the tree

The exclusion or inclusion of filter parameters is exclusive, as in other commands
which use both include and exclude filters.

In order to make the include filter work efficiently, an additional read pass through the
directory tree is needed to identify the subdirectories and their parents for the
inclusion of files to work effectively. Otherwise the full directory tree needs to be included
which as a consequence may contain quite a lot of empty subdirectories. The first read pass
avoids this issue, but it might take a bit more time, depending on the network speed of
the backend storage and the size of the snapshot.

The --snapshot-summary parameter adds summary data to the snapshot summary section, as already
described in the solution to issue 4942.

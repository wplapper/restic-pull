Issue #5109 - Selection of packs to repack based on size

Add option --small-pack-size so prune can repack all packfiles smaller than small-pack-size bytes.
The new option is passed onto internal/repository/prune.go.
A new decision has been added to "decide what to do" to
move the intended packfiles onto the repackSmallCandidates queue.

The decision what to do with the candidate in repackSmallCandidates has been modofied,
so prune can be forced to process the intended repacking operation -by setting
--max-unused to a low value.
